# GeoML

GeoMl is 2D geometry library for OcaML. 
It provides basic operations on geometric shapes. It also implements several cool algorithms like emo welzl's smallest enclosing disk algorithm or Graham's scan method for finding a convex hull.

### Build

```sh
$ make
```
- The documentation 
```sh
$ make doc 
```
- The tests 
```sh
$ make test 
```
