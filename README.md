# GeoML

GeoMl is 2D geometry library for Ocaml. 
It provides basic operations on geometric shapes.
It also implements several cool algorithms :

* Emo Welzl's smallest enclosing disk algorithm
* Graham's scan method for finding a convex hull.
* Weiler-Atherton for polygon clipping


### Build 
- The library: 
```sh
$ make
```
