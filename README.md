# GeoML

GeoMl is 2D geometry library for Ocaml. 
It provides basic operations on geometric shapes.
It also implements several cool algorithms :

* Emo Welzl's smallest enclosing disk algorithm
* Graham's scan method for finding a convex hull.
* Weiler-Atherton for polygon clipping


### Build 
- The library: 
```sh
$ make
```
- The documentation 
```sh
$ make doc 
```
- The tests 
```sh
$ make tests
```

### Current
GeoML is currently still in developpement, and have not been tested (nor proved, nor model-checked nor analyzed ... but you know what we say about well typed program ;)).
You are free to contact any member of the developpement team if you want to propose a feature you think it may be cool to have in GeoML.
